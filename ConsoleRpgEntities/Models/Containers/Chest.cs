/// Lifecycle states:
///   - Locked + pickable  -> player can attempt to pick or use matching key
///   - Locked + unpickable + no key -> chest cannot be opened
///   - Trapped            -> first open attempt triggers the trap effect
///   - Open               -> items can be taken/added

/// Week 14 will add Room as a Container subclass. Rooms hold items on the
/// floor. Notice that nothing about Chest has to change when Room is added -
